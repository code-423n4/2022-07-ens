I mean no one has problem in finding contracts, however it can be confusing for new people. Path to contracts is relative 
`### [DNSSECImpl.sol](contracts/dnssec-oracle/DNSSECImpl.sol)`, that is why we have what we have.

[07/14/2022 7:33 AM] JohnSmith#1623
Looking at tests, this function works with hex strings like this
`require(hex'0361626300'.nameLength(0) == 5, "nameLength('abc.') == 5");`
Can't find yet where such strings are created.
'abc' to hex will be '616263', but where  are other peaces inserted?


[07/14/2022 7:35 AM] nickjohnson
Names used by the wrapper are encoded in DNS wire format, which consists of a 1 byte length, followed by that many bytes of label


[07/14/2022 7:36 AM] nickjohnson
So 'test.xyz' is 0x04 + test + 0x03 + xyz + 0x00


[07/14/2022 8:09 AM] JohnSmith#1623
makes sense, but where do we get such encoded strings from?

How would you prioritize the order of auditing, is there any points of concerns in the files ?


[07/14/2022 9:59 AM] nickjohnson
The name wrapper has been audited before, but extensively changed since then, and some of the permission model is quite complex - so it's worth a close look.


[07/14/2022 9:59 AM] nickjohnson
The DNSSEC code is complex and has not been audited before, so also worth a close look.

Permission model in the wrapper right


[07/15/2022 1:01 PM] nickjohnson
Correct


[07/15/2022 1:01 PM] nickjohnson
I don't believe we published them anywhere, but the wrapper has changed enough since then that it may not be that useful anyway

Can anyone tell me how a registrar would get created for a sub-domain?


[07/16/2022 1:17 AM] 100proof
What's the process that would get followed?


[07/16/2022 4:32 AM] jeff_lau
You would create a contract that calls `wrapper.setSubnodeOwner` and approve that contract as owner of the name


[07/16/2022 6:54 AM] 100proof
Nice. So anyone could become their own registrar by buying a domain and then become the registrar for the sub-domains, right?

[07/16/2022 3:03 PM] premm.eth
To be clear I think the word is "operator" not "owner" ?


[07/16/2022 11:30 PM] 100proof
So, now I'm a little confused and I wonder if one of the sponsors could help me out.


[07/16/2022 11:32 PM] 100proof
It's clear that there is a lot of functionality in `NameWrapper` for handling sub-domains, sub-sub-domains and so on, for as many levels deep as you might require. However, the `registrar` in the `NameWrapper` contract is fixed/immutable. So, if a person wanted to become their own registrar of, say, `blah.eth` then they couldn't really use `NameWrapper` anymore because they'd want to use their own `registrar` contract, right? Is this correct? Is the `NameWrapper` contract just for use with `.eth` and direct sub-domains? If so, why does it have functionality for sub-sub-domains etc?


[07/17/2022 12:28 AM] JM217#0899
`ssee.fried.eth` like thing


[07/17/2022 12:28 AM] JM217#0899
I wonder if someone needs to be a `registrar` of his domain


[07/17/2022 1:02 AM] premm.eth
If you own a name, you can create as many subdomains as you like, if you own those subdomains, then you can make sub subdomains. If the name is wrapped in the NameWrapper then those subdomains are ERC-1155 NFTs. This is the main function of the NameWrapper. If however, you don't want to register one sub at a time, using your externally owned account (EOA), that's where a registrar comes in. A registrar is a smart contract that you give the same permissions to as your EOA, think of it like a box office for a theater, it only does what the owner wants. 

If you want it to create subdomains and issue them to the public, for a fee for example, then you can create a contact that does that. I think the confusion lies in the fact that .eth is actually a independent domain, so it has an owner, and that owner happens to be a registrar, which is also a wrapper of .eth subs, i.e., 2LD domains, e.g., vitalik.eth. The composable nature of ENS names, means that things can be configured in different ways, but there are base structures, e.g. wrappers, registrars, and controllers, and these things all can come together in different ways. 

If you tell me your application I can tell you how it could be set up.


[07/17/2022 1:52 AM] 100proof
I'm interested in how reclaiming works. Say someone registers `defi.eth` and then the owner of that goes on to sell the sub-domain `curve.defi.eth`.  I'm aware that, technically, the owner of `defi.eth` can take back `curve.defi.eth` from them.  (I also realise that the `PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL` fuse functionality in `NameWrapper` is meant to prevent this). But how is this done in practice? What contract calls would need to be performed for `defi.eth` to take back `curve.defi.eth`?


[07/17/2022 2:24 AM] premm.eth
The first two fuses that need to be set on subnames in order to set other fuses are PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL and CANNOT_UNWRAP. This effectively protects the subname owner from the parent taking the name back, as long as the expiry of the fuses of the subname is not expired. 

If these fuses are not set, then the parent name owner, e.g., defi.eth, can call setSubnodeOwner, or setSubnodeRecord to set the owner to himself, and then call unwrap, to fully take back and unwrap the name.


[07/17/2022 2:25 AM] 100proof
But this is only if you choose to use the `NameWrapper` contract. I'm trying to get my head around the scenario where person A buys `defi.eth` and then chooses NOT to uses this infrastructure. They're allowed to, right?


[07/17/2022 2:32 AM] premm.eth
They can do whatever they want.


[07/17/2022 2:34 AM] 100proof
Great. So, now they sell `curve.defi.eth`. Then they choose to take it back. How exactly do they do this? By doing appropriate calls to the ENS registrar?


[07/17/2022 2:34 AM] izhuer
I guess, in `ETHRegistrarController.sol`, it will use `nameWrapper.registerAndWrapETH2LD` by default?


[07/17/2022 2:34 AM] 100proof
@izhuer were you answering my question?


[07/17/2022 2:34 AM] izhuer
since the controller is the  user interface, I suspect


[07/17/2022 2:35 AM] izhuer
I think so? Lol, I mean, seems that users are forced to use `NameWrapper`?


[07/17/2022 2:35 AM] 100proof
We've been told this is not the case above.


[07/17/2022 2:36 AM] izhuer
Lol, I see.


[07/17/2022 2:36 AM] 100proof
It seems to be up to you whether you want to use it or not.


[07/17/2022 2:36 AM] izhuer
I did not check the previous channel, my bad


[07/17/2022 2:37 AM] izhuer
hope some sponsor could show up somehow, lol. It seems that sponsors are not in the same time zone with me, Lol


[07/17/2022 2:37 AM] 100proof
Yeah, I think I'll have to wait until the sponsors wake up.


[07/17/2022 2:42 AM] premm.eth
The new ETHRegistrarController.sol automatically wraps the name, but the fuses which are set are up to the user. If the user sets no fuses, then the user can unwrap.

I would assume that defi.eth is already registered, therefore not wrapped.


[07/17/2022 2:44 AM] 100proof
Yes, in my scenario it is not wrapped, and then they become their own registrar, perhaps even using their own smart contract, and then they sell `curve.defi.eth` to someone. Then they decide to be malicious and take back the domain. Apparently they could do this... but how?


[07/17/2022 2:57 AM] premm.eth
If PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL and CANNOT_UNWRAP are burnt then they cannot take it back unless the fuses expire. The way to make it totally locked down is to register the parent name for 100 years, and then set the expiry of the fuses to 100 years as well.


[07/17/2022 2:57 AM] 100proof
But I'm not talking about using `NameWrapper`


[07/17/2022 2:58 AM] 100proof
I'm referring to this scenario: https://docs.ens.domains/contract-developer-guide/writing-a-registrar


[07/17/2022 2:58 AM] premm.eth
The way it currently is, there is no way to protect the subname owner, without creating custom contracts


[07/17/2022 2:59 AM] 100proof
Great. I picked that up. However, I want to know _how_ the domain holder (e.g. `defi.eth` takes the sub domain (e.g. `curve.defi.eth`) off the person they sold it to.


[07/17/2022 2:59 AM] 100proof
Is this by calling the `ENSRegistry` contract or similar?


[07/17/2022 3:00 AM] 100proof
It can't have anything to do with `NameWrapper` or `BaseRegistrarImplementation` since you're not forced to use those contracts.


[07/17/2022 3:00 AM] 100proof
I'm just trying to get my head around how all the jigsaw pieces fit together.


[07/17/2022 3:02 AM] 100proof
From here https://docs.ens.domains/contract-developer-guide/writing-a-registrar we learn that somehow you could take back ownership of their names. What exactly is the mechanism?

Yes, that's got to be it! Thanks.


[07/17/2022 3:09 AM] premm.eth
No problem, it can be hard to see what is going on because of all the connected contracts, but the base is the registry which is pretty simple.


[07/17/2022 9:41 AM] scaraven
If I understand correctly, for 2nd level domains on .eth the owner will be BaseRegistrarImplementation.sol. A new user can register a 2ld domains using ETHRegistrarController but if they want their domain name to be represented as a `ERC1155` token then they can transfer ownership to Namewrapper and receive a token in return using `wrapETH2LD`?


[07/17/2022 1:12 PM] jeff_lau
Yes this will be the case. The NameWrapper will be deployed first. And all .eth names are able to migrate using wrapETH2LD. Once the new controller is deployed, the name will be automatically wrapped

Hey, I was wondering if we could get some feedback from C4 staff/sponsors about how to classify any bugs we find. User funds aren't a huge part of this particular project. Most of the potential attacks are about stealing domains or making them unusable, etc. How exactly should we go about classifying any exploits we might find? I only say this because High is usually associated with stealing/locking-up funds.

I would suggest that anything that allows someone to take control of someone else's name, or makes it unusable, would qualify


[07/18/2022 6:56 AM] 100proof
And what about being able to get around fuse restrictions? Medium? High?


[07/18/2022 8:55 AM] nickjohnson
Depends on the impact. If the owner of a parent domain can get around fuse restrictions preventing them from controlling a subdomain, definitely high

[07/19/2022 7:02 PM] nickjohnson
Calldata is cheap, but a compliant 1155 implementation can use only a single storage slot update, while 721 requires every mint and transfer to update the `balanceOf` mapping.
